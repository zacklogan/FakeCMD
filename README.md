##Fake command prompt!
A simple recreation of the default Windows command prompt.  
This can be used for scambaiting or whatever else you feel like.  
There is a switch in Form1.cs where you can define custom commands. The exe is found in the debug folder.  
If you want to replace the default Windows command prompt with this one check out RunHijacker at https://github.com/justinoboyle!
##Built in commands!  
`tree` - shows a tree!  
`netstat` - shows a fake scan then says the technician is the problem, not the computer.  
`dir /s` - spams YOU ARE AN IDIOT!  
`cd ../` - goes to the C:\ directory  
More will be added soon and feel free to contribute!
